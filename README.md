## What Atomos Is

Atomos is a minimal React development environment built on top of Vite.  
It keeps Vite’s fast engine but applies streamlined defaults, cleaner structure, and custom branding with Tailwind CSS Preincluded.

It’s not a new bundler.  
It’s a refined experience.

---

## Why It Exists

Atomos exists to:

- Reduce unnecessary configuration noise
- Provide a cleaner starting structure
- Offer a more opinionated, minimal setup
- Create a simplified development workflow

Instead of rebuilding tooling from scratch, Atomos focuses on refining what already works well.

## How It’s Different from Vite

Atomos is built on Vite, but:

- Applies opinionated defaults
- Encourages a minimal file structure
- Uses custom branding and CLI behavior
- Focuses on simplicity over flexibility
- Has Tailwind CSS Pre-installed in it

Vite is a powerful general-purpose tool.  
Atomos is a streamlined experience built on top of it.
